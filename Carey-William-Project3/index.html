			<h2 id= "carHistory"> Cars & Their Early History </h2>
				<p><img src="images/1432200170_CarGrey.png" alt="car"/> The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car. In that year, German inventor <em>Karl Benz</em> built the Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars did not become widely available until the early 20th century. 
				One of the first cars that was accessible to the masses was the <em>1908 Model T</em>, an American car manufactured by the <em>Ford Motor Company</em>. Cars were rapidly adopted in the United States of America, 
				where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other, less developed, parts of the world.</p>

			<h2 id= "carsIDrive"> Cars I Drive </h2>
			<p> <img src="images/1432200180_TowTruckYellow.png" alt="car"/> I received my first car from my mother in 2006 as a gift. It was her previous car, a <em>2002 Honda Accord</em>. I loved this car and eventually came up with the nickname <strong>Eragon</strong>.
			I received my second car in 2011 as a wedding gift from my aunt. A <em>Mercendes Benz C-230 Kompressor</em>, which later named <strong>Ivory</strong>. I just recently brought my wife and I a
			<em>Dodge Journey</em>, aka <strong>IRee</strong>, after the birth of our second child, unfortunately with all of that I had to let go of Eragon to make space.</p>
