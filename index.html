    <h1><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle"> What is a Motorcycle</a> </h1>
    	<p> A <em>motorcycle</em> (also called a <em>motorbike, bike, moto</em> or <em>cycle</em>) is a two[not in citation gi or three wheeled[2] motor vehicle. Motorcycle design varies greatly to suit a range of different purposes: long distance travel, commuting, cruising, sport including racing, and off-road riding.</p>
    		<ul>
    		    <li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_bike">Sport</a></strong> – the rider leans forwards into the wind and the weight of the upper torso is supported by the rider's core at low speed and air pressure at high speed (e.g., above 50 mph (80 km/h)). The footpegs are below the rider or to the rear. The reduced frontal area cuts wind resistance and allows higher speeds. At low-speed this position throws the weight of the rider onto the arms, which can tire the rider's wrists.</li>
    			<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_motorcycles#Standard">Standard</a></strong> – the rider sits upright or leans forward slightly. The feet are below the rider. These are motorcycles that are not specialised to one task, so they do not excel in any particular area. The standard posture is used with touring and commuting as well as dirt and dual-sport bikes, and may offer advantages for beginners.</li>
    			<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruiser_%28motorcycle%29">Cruiser</a></strong> – the rider sits at a lower seat height with the upper torso upright or leaning slightly rearward. Legs are extended forwards, sometimes out of reach of the regular controls on cruiser pegs. The low seat height can be a consideration for new or short riders. Handlebars tend to be high and wide. The emphasis is on comfort, while compromising cornering ability because of low ground clearance and the greater likelihood of scraping foot pegs, floor boards, or other parts if turns are taken at the speeds other motorcycles can more readily accomplish.</li>

    <h2> Motorcycle History </h2>
    	<p> In 1894, <em>Hildebrand & Wolfmüller</em> became the first series production motorcycle, and the first to be called a motorcycle (German: Motorrad). <em>Excelsior Motor Company</em>, originally a bicycle manufacturing company based in Coventry, England, began production of their first motorcycle model in 1896. The first production motorcycle in the US was the Orient-Aster, built by <a href="http://www.theworldofmotorcycles.com/vintage_motorcycle_marsh-metz.html">Charles Metz</a> in 1898 at his factory in Waltham, Massachusetts. In the early period of motorcycle history, many producers of bicycles adapted their designs to accommodate the new internal combustion engine. As the engines became more powerful and designs outgrew the bicycle origins, the number of motorcycle producers increased.
    	In 1898, <em>Triumph</em> Motorcycles in England began producing motorbikes, and by 1903 it was producing over 500 bikes. Other British firms were <em>Royal Enfield, Norton</em> and <em>Birmingham Small Arms Company</em> who began motorbike production in 1899, 1902 and 1910, respectively. Indian began production in 1901 and Harley Davidson was established two years later. By the outbreak of the First World War, the largest motorcycle manufacturer in the world was Indian, producing over 20,000 bikes per year.During the First World War, motorbike production was greatly ramped up for the war effort to supply effective communications with front line troops. Messengers on horses were replaced with despatch riders on motorcycles carrying messages, performing reconnaissance personnel and acting as a military police. 
    	American company <em>Harley-Davidson</em> <abbr>HD</abbr> was devoting over 50% of its factory output toward military contract by the end of the war. The British company Triumph Motorcycles sold more than 30,000 of its Triumph Type H model to allied forces during the war. The Model H in particular, is regarded by many as having been the first "modern motorcycle".[22] Introduced in 1915 it had a 550 cc side-valve four-stroke engine with a three-speed gearbox and belt transmission. It was so popular with its users that it was nicknamed the "Trusty Triumph."</p>
    	
    <h2> What I Ride</h2>
    	<p> HD XL1200N "Nightster" first of the Dark Customs, combined LED tail/brake/indicator lights, tapered silencers (EU) and side mounted LED lit licence plate, 11-inch shocks, and baloney cut silencers (US), mid-controls and wire wheels </p>
    	<p> Introduced in 2007, the XL1200N Nightster included (then) unique features such as a bobbed rear fender, front fork gaiters, and a side mount license plate. The riding position and 25.3-inch (643 mm) seat height of the Nightster are the same as those of the XL883L Sportster Low - UK version (along with Iron 883 and Forty-Eight) has central number plate, 13.5-inch rear shocks, tapered silencers, and combined LED indicator/tail/brake lights.</p>
		<p> The Harley Iron was released in 2009 as a smaller displacement version of the Nightster. The major differences are blacked out engine, cast wheels instead of laced; narrower handlebars; and of course the smaller engine displacement.</p>
